~I am running into some issues with connecting to the database which is making finishing this application rather difficult. 

As of right now, I'm going to give this a break and work on the gist clone repo. The actual application runs and there is a very basic UI, but the actual messages are not displayed. Once that is figured out then I will call it done for now as this was more of a proof of concept and practice for myself.
